'''The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. 
A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot 
(.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on 
the variable name. You can apply a variety of methods to a str variable, like upper, lower, etc.'''
