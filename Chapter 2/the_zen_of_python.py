''' Experienced Python programmers will encourage you to avoid complexity 
and aim for simplicity whenever possible. The Python community’s philosophy
is contained in “The Zen of Python” by Tim Peters. You can access this 
brief set of principles for writing good Python code by entering import this 
into your interpreter. I won’t reproduce the entire “Zen of Python” here, but 
I’ll share a few lines to help you understand why they should be important 
to you as a beginning Python programmer. '''
